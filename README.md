Auth0 Webtasks is a platform for easily creating a serverless HTTP Endpoint / Webhook. Auth0 Webtasks executes node.js code in a secure and safe manner. There's no servers to deploy, no tools you have to install, just code. 

* Every webtask is an HTTP endpoint
* Simple Node.js programming model
* High fidelity of HTTP, webtasks can even return HTML
* Full access to node modules available on npmjs.com
* Rich browser based editing experience
* Middleware 
* Multi-tenant


## How does it differ from other Serverless offerings?

* Specialized for Node.js
* Low configuration
* Highly customizable
* Extremely low latency
* Designed from scratch for web-based / user interactions rather than plumbing between backend services.
